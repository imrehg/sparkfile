# Sparfile

This is a [Sparkfile](https://medium.com/the-writers-room/the-spark-file-8d6e7df7ae58) for dumping tech project ideas, things I'd like to make. The notes are ad-hoc, not expected to be up to date, relevant, or in any way accurate, nor organized. It's a tool to declutter my ideas, and keep track of inspriration

It's mostly created for my own use, but if you see anything that's interesting for you, feel free to ping me (e.g. [@imrehg](https://twitter.com/imrehg)).
